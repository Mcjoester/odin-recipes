       <h1>Salmon Florentine</h1>

       <h3>A succulent white wine reduction sauce over salmon on a bed of spinach</h3>
       <p> This is my favorite post workout dish. It gives you all the nutrients you need to recover from a workout, especially a health amount of protein. This is my go to dish when I'm a cut as it has very little carbs to offer. I prefer to get the salmon fresh from sprouts and you can really taste the difference compared to frozen bought.  </p>

       <h4>Ingredients</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
           <li>1/2 white onion, sliced</li>
           <li>2 cloves garlic, minced, divided</li>
           <li>2 (4 ounces) salmon steaks</li>
           <li>1 cup semi-dry white wine(such as Chablis)</li>
           <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
           <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
           <li>2 cups chopped spinach</li>
       </ul>

       <h4>Steps</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>Melt 1/2 cup butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion and 1/2 of the garlic, breaking onion into rings, until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Add salmon to onion mixture and cook until salmon is about 1/4-cooked, about 2 minutes.</li>
           <li>Pour wine and cream over salmon and cook, stirring lightly and flipping salmon halfway through, until liquid is reduced by 1/2 and salmon flakes easily with a fork, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
           <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir remaining garlic until fragrant and golden, 1 to 3 minutes. Add spinach and cook until spinach is wilted, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
           <li>Place spinach on 2 serving plates, making a well in the center of each. Arrange each salmon steak in the center of the well and pour sauce over each. Garnish salmon with onion.</li>
       </ol>
