       <h3>These spicy, Mexican-inspired grilled chicken breasts will turn any backyard BBQ into a fiesta! </h3>
       <p>
           This is my go to dish when inviting friends over for a BBQ. People love it. I love it. Even friends that don't like spicy food love it! I stumbled upon the recipe while browsing for something new to meal prep and once I tasted that homemade chipotle flavor I have not looked back. This is the one. There are no better recipes than this one.

       <h4>Ingredients</h4>
       <ul>
           <li>1 (7ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce</li>
           <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
           <li>2 cloves, peeled</li>
           <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
           <li>2 limes, juiced, divided</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin (optional)</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano (optional)</li>
           <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
           <li>1/8 cup water, or as needed</li>
           <li>4 skinless, bonesless chicken breast halves, butterflied</li>
           1 bunch fresh cilantro, chopped
       </ul>

       <h4>Steps</h4>
       <ol>
           <li>Combine 1 to 5 chipotle peppers with their sauce, onion, garlic, olive oil, juice of 1 lime, cumin, oregano, and salt in a food processor. Blend until smooth, adding water as needed if too thick. Reserve a small amount of marinade mixture to serve with grilled chicken.</li>
           <li>Combine chicken with marinade in a plastic storage bag. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
           <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade and discard excess.</li>
           <li>Place chicken breasts on the preheated grill and cook until no longer pink in the center and juices run clear, about 8 minutes per side, being careful not to overcook.</li>
           <li>Remove chicken from the grill and transfer to a plate. Squeeze juice of remaining lime onto chicken and garnish with cilantro. Serve with reserved marinade mixture.</li>
       </ol>
