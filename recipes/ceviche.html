      <h3>This is Authentic Mexican Ceviche. Everytime I make it for a gathering it's a hit.</h3>
      <p>
          This is my go to summer dish to cool of and feel refreshed. It's perfect for a pool party or even better, it's perfect for a day out at the beach. Whatever the case may be, this dish will leave you thinking about in the winter months. Although, who's to say you can't treat yourself and make this refreshing dish in the winter? Treat yourself.

          <li>2 white onions, finely chopped</li>
          <li>1 cucumber, peeled and finely chopped</li>

      <h4>Steps</h4>
      <ol>
          <li>Place shrimp in a bowl (You may either coarsely chop the shrimp, or leave them whole, depending on your preference.) Add lemon, covering shrimp completely. Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or until opaque and slightly firm.</li>
          <li>Add tomatoes, onions, cucumber, radishes, and garlic; toss to combine. Gradually add cilantro and jalapenos to desired taste (jalapeno will grow stronger while marinating).
